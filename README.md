# Machine-Learning
## ðŸ“˜Task
In this course, we have four task to learn the machine learning. It covers linear regression, classification, clustering, and matrix factorization.

```

â”œâ”€â”€ Linear regression     # Use Boston House Dataset
â”œâ”€â”€ classification        # Datasetï¼šhttps://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/236/seeds 
â”œâ”€â”€ clustering

## ðŸ“‚Course Project
In this project, we collected the remote sensing data of Shenzhen and predicted the visibility of Shenzhen roads through the characteristics of weather, temperature, humidity and so on. This project uses three models of linear regression, ridge regression and random forest to predict, and evaluates the results of the three models.

## ðŸ“°Term Paper
In this paper, we use gradient boosting regression to re predict the visibility of roads in Shenzhen, and use a new method to solve the old problem. See the folder for specific experimental contents, codes and results.
